What is your favorite movie?
13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi
If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
Japan
If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
If I could have any superpower I would want super-speed. I would want this power because growing up speedster characters such as the flash, quicksilver, and others have always been my favorite. I also find it real cool in some of those verses how they can manipulate time and travel into the future or past.
